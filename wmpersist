# wmpersist
#   - save/load browser window titles to winname mappings
#   - works with ratpoison window manager
#
# usage:
#   "wmpersist save X": write out chromium window titles to
#                     ratpoison winname mappings
#
#   "wmpersist load X": take existing windows, search for
#                     titles in the save file, and
#                     rename/renumber within ratpoison to
#                     match them, once chromium has been
#                     restarted (typically following a crash,
#                     which happens frequently)
#
#   second arg (X): chrome or brave (which browser to save/load for)
